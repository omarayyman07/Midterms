### Exercise 1: String Reversal

**Description:**  
This exercise demonstrates how to reverse the characters in a string. The method iterates through the string from the last character to the first, appending each character to a new string, effectively reversing the input string.

### Exercise 2: Wordle Game

**Description:**  
In this exercise, a simple Wordle-like game is implemented. The program generates a random 3-letter word and asks the user to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating which letters were correct and in the correct positions. If the user guesses the word or types "quit", the game ends.

### Exercise 3: Maximum Value from Digits

**Description:**  
This exercise aims to find the maximum value that can be obtained from a given number by performing operations on its digits. The operations allowed are addition and multiplication. The program iterates through the digits of the number and calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing either addition or multiplication at each step.

### Exercise 4: Non-Repeated Character Finder

**Description:**  
This exercise involves finding the index of the first non-repeated character in a given string. The program iterates through the string and checks for each character if it appears more than once. If a character is non-repeated, its index is returned. If no non-repeated character is found, the program returns `-1`.

---

### Exercise 5: Word Comparison with Spaces

**Description:**  
In this exercise, two strings of equal length are compared character by character. If the characters match at a given position, the character is added to the result string. If the characters do not match, a space is added instead. The program provides feedback by showing the correctly guessed letters in their respective positions, and spaces where the letters did not match.
